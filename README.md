# Fire Alert Notification System
This repository is a lightweight backend service built with Express.js that leverages Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver real-time notifications. Designed for rapid and reliable alerting, it allows you to send notifications either to a specific device by its FCM token or to all devices subscribed to a designated topic.
